# Using Blockchains for Voting process

•	Using Go-Etherium permissioned Proof of Authority(POA) blockchain. 

•	A web app for building a novel electronic voting system based on blockchain that addresses some of the limitations in existing systems and constructing a transparent and secure blockchain-based e-voting system using Azure blockchain services.

•	Registration of users and authentication protocol(biometrics) through the portal

•	Hashed details like voter ID, time, Vote , IP address and location are sent through the nodes(blocks). The blocks are chained in such a way that each block has a hash that is a function of the previous block starting from the Root Hash, and thus by induction the complete prior chain, thereby assuring immutability.

##	Solutions to Common Problems-

•	Non-availability of Internet/Remote Areas- An application is provided which will send the hash key for each person after authenticating him based on biometrics in that area.

•	Survey of all the areas before the election process starts about the location's facilities and provide the offline application.

•	Taking details of the deceased prior to the election and removing their eligibility to participate.

•	Sending text messages to all the eligible candidates prior elections and sending timed OTPs while they cast their votes.

•	Timely updation and display of the percentage of votes in the portal.

•	Obtaining the list of new eligible candidates and sending SMS to register to ensure maximum participation.

## Technology stack-

•	Azure Blockchain Services as cloud computing Service

•	GitHub for version control

•	Go-Etherium(Geth) blockchain framework

•	Azure SQL database

•	Visual Studio Code language support extension for Solidity smart contracts

•	NodeJS

•	AngularJS(Front-end)

•	SHA1 algorithm
